# This sample YAML file shows how to configure an Azure Pipeline to analyze a repository using the CodeQL CLI Bundle
#
# It assumes a Windows environment and use indirect build tracing ("sandwich mode") around an existing set of build commands
#
# It requires:
# - PowerShell Core to be on the Pipeline image
# - a GitHub access token to be set in the pipeline Variables as a secret variable
# - Advanced Security to be enabled on the GitHub repository

# ℹ️ You will need to replace parts of this pipeline with your own triggers, preparatory Tasks and build Task, etc. marked with pointing hands 👉
#    You may also wish to edit the query suite/language as appropriate on :164

# ***** replace this 👇 with your actual triggers; these are just examples ******
trigger:
    branches:
        include:
        - '*'
    paths:
        exclude:
        - test/*
        - doc/*
        - lib/*
        include:
        - src/*
# ***** replace this 👆 with your actual triggers; these are just examples ******

# ***** replace this 👇 with your actual resources; these are just examples. This can be defined outside of the pipeline YAML ******
resources:
  repositories:
  - repository: templates
      type: github
      name: octo-org/example-repo-2
      endpoint: octo-org
# ***** replace this 👆 with your actual resources; these are just examples. This can be defined outside of the pipeline YAML ******

# ***** replace this 👆 with your real stage/job details; this is just an example ******
stages:
- stage: __default
    jobs:
    - job: Job
        workspace:
            clean: all
        pool:
          vmImage: 'windows-latest'  # 👈 replace this with your own required pool, ensuring that PowerShell Core is installed on the image
# ***** replace this 👆 with your real stage/job details; this is just an example ******
